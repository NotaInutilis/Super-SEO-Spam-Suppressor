# Super SEO Spam Suppressor (SSSS[^SSSS])

An anticapitalist blocklist targeting websites abusing SEO tactics to spam web searches with data pollution and security risks: junk news, content farms, scams, impersonations, fads and bubbles (Web3 or genAI), and all other kinds of useless wasteful garbage.
It is best used with uBlacklist.

[^SSSS]: It's a Gridman reference. I'm spelling it out because it's also the name of a skin disease: don't go looking for SSSS on image search.

[Since 2019, Google's search functions are being destroyed](https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-men-who-killed-google/): [it is now scientifically proven](https://downloads.webis.de/publications/papers/bevendorff_2024a.pdf) that [the biggest search engine on the internet has become a barely useable, terminally enshittified mess](https://www.themarysue.com/google-search-is-busted/), merely a husk of the wonderful discovery tool it was yesterday.
Do you want to learn about *thing*?
[How about **buying** *thing* and **consuming** *thing* instead?](https://www.wired.com/story/google-antitrust-lawsuit-search-results/)
Its drive to commercialize our every online interaction also has consequences on other, much more user friendly search engines such as DuckDuckGo, whose indexers crawl through [shit optimized for Google's terrible algorithm](https://www.theverge.com/c/23998379/google-search-seo-algorithm-webpage-optimization).
Plus the latest trend of so-called "artificial intelligence" generative models produces even more garbage at an ever growing pace.
This list is, as any good adblocking tool is, an attempt to escape this neverending capitalist coercition and attention theft.
All of the tech giants play this game so consider also using a social media blocklist.

## How to contribute

Clone this repository and add one domain per line in `.txt` files stored in the `sources/domains` folder. Blocked sites are organized using subfolders and `.txt` files within the `sources/domains` folder. Use comments (`#`) and markdown files (`.md`) to add more information and references.

> For the `https://www.example.com` website, add `example.com` on a new line of the `sources/domains/default.txt` file.

You can paste the full URL: the update script will clean it and make it a domain. As the hosts format does not automatically block subdomains (e.g. `subdomain.example.com`), they have to be explicitely added to the list to maintain compatibility.

It is possible to add TLDs (e.g. `com`, without the dot) to the list, they will be blocked by Dnsmasq, adblockers and uBlacklist. Domains related to Fediverse instances (Mastodon, Peertube, etc.) should be put in `.txt` files with `fediverse` in their names (e.g. `Bad Fediverse is bad.txt`) so that they are included in the Fediverse blocklists.

Then, when you push your changes to the `sources` folder, GitHub actions automatically generate new versions of the blocklists. Should you want to generate them yourself, you can run the `scripts/update.sh` script (prerequisites : bash, python).

Finally, make a pull request: it will be reviewed and approved within a few days.

### Importing an external list

External lists can be imported by adding them to the `sources/imports/importlist.txt` as a new line in the following format: `list name.txt|url`. They are automatically downloaded twice a day, cleaned (some formats only), copied to the `sources/domains/_imported/` folder and thus added to the list generation database. The domain list in the `sources/imports/allowlist.txt` file serves as an exception ruleset for imported lists.

### How to contribute (easy mode)

If you have no idea how Git works, you can still contribute! Just [open an issue](https://github.com/NotaInutilis/Super-SEO-Spam-Suppressor/issues) with the URLs you would like to add to the list (or remove, false positives happen!), grouping them by language and categories if possible. We'll check and add them shortly.

### Report malicious websites

The next best thing to do after adding a malicious website (malware, phishing, scam) to this list is to to report it so it actually doesn't show up in searches, or even gets taken offline by its host or registrar!

## Fandom (formerly known as Wikia)

[Fandom is bad for a number of reasons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcfuA_UAz3I), including aggressive SEO tactics and stealing content from its contributors.
This list is not blocking its search results, which consistently appear on top of any fan-wiki related request, but instead advises to install extensions such as [Indie Wiki Buddy](https://getindie.wiki/) and [wiki.gg Redirect](https://www.wiki.gg/redirect). These take advantage of these SEO boosted results to replace them with redirection to independent and community owned wikis.
